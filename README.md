# Offworld Dragon: Supernova
 
A space game that has been many years in the making, through many different versions and such. Using this GitHub I can keep track of each version from now on.

This is technically the 3rd iteration, may place the older versions in different branches.

## About

Offworld Dragon: Supernova is meant to be a mix of first-person (or maybe third-person) shooter with space flight combat.

You play as Sei, a dragon-like being called a Drakalian hailing from a planet called Akala, solving problems by either shooting them, whether it be in the depths of space or on the cold hard ground. However, strange occurrences breach the somewhat peaceful merc's life, and now he's sent on a journey across the stars to figure out what's going on.

## Game Idea

Honestly, don't know how to organise this so just have a wall.

The game will consist of multiple planets that will be "levels", with each planet having a set amount of missions to do. In order to reach these planets, you start in the main hub world, where you can set up your equipment and see what story missions you have to do. From there, you select a planet you want to go to and enter your ship. A fade to black will happen and you'll fade back in at the planet's starport. At the starport, you can select what mission you want to do on the planet itself.

Travelling between the hub world to a planet is meant to be automated, but there are chances to be interdicted along the way, playing a warning and forcing you into a procedurally generated space "arena" to perform space combat. These interdictions can be used for story reasons or just random encounters or even to help save people. when you have finished an interdiction, you can collect scrap and materials in the area before leaving once again to your destination.

When you finally select a mission on a planet, you'll be transported down in your ship where you can explore the atmosphere through flight. each planet will have designated landing points that you can discover so you can land closer to objectives or call your ship. Think of these as fast travel points, but you control where you move. Sometimes ground forces can attack your ship, and enemy fighters may appear too.

Once you are at a landing point, that's when the on-foot gameplay begins as you explore and collect on foot. You can explore the planet as much as you want on foot, however, in order to leave the planet, you need to return to your ship. You can call your ship to evacuate you, but you can't use this everywhere (for example, entering a dungeon, or entering a heavily defended area). For heavily defended areas, you can attempt to evacuate, at the cost of taking heavy damage and potentially losing resources you have gathered. You'll also initiate a "chase" where you simply fight waves of enemies in space until you are in the clear.

Think of it as Super Mario 64 but you play in the loading screens and transitioning screens.
